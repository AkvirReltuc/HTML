<h1>The Best Entertainment According to Rivka</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 </h2>

<hr />
<h3>Rabbi Yoel Gold </h3>
<p>Rabbi Yoel Golds videos are inspirational moving and meaningful a whole new approach to entertainment 
    you will find yourself crying, smiling and will always come away having learned somthing new
</p>

<h3>Meaningful People</h3>
<p>Meaningful people by Nachi Gorden are interview with inspiring influential and interesting people 
    from all walks of the Jewish culture each with a unique story and message to share.
    I would definitely reccomend Ayele Enacace, a former christian/ witch now convert or Rabbi and Mrs Rosen founder of A.T.I.M.E (an organisation that supports those struggeling with infertility)
    or Rivka Shotkn an amazing 16 year old girl who suffered a skiing accident that left her a quadraplegic and her amazing outview on life
